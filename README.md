The generated password is then displayed in a designated area on the webpage, allowing users to easily copy it to their clipboard for immediate use.

The CSS styling ensures that the interface is visually appealing and user-friendly, with responsive design elements to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

Overall, the Random Password Generator offers a practical solution for generating strong and secure passwords, helping users improve their online security practices.
